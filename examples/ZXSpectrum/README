This folder contains an example of using EDL to create a ZXSpectrum Emulator.

2 seperate executables are built, spectrum.exe and spectrumSimple.exe.

Both use a common.c file to handle the spectrum hardware + tzx,tap,raw and sna support. (at present a .tzx,.raw,.tap can be supplied on the command line).

You will need to place a 48k.rom into roms/

This has audio support, you will need OpenAL SDK.
