<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a work in progress account of the development of a language for writing emulators. </p>

<p>In the future I hope to have some actual documentation for EDL up on this website, along with a number of samples. </p>

<p>At present the language has allowed the development of a cycle accurate (down to the pins) Intel 8080 cpu. A Space Invaders emulator was then quickly written in C to prove the validity of the work so far.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p></p>
<li>Port the remainder of the invaders emulation to the new language</li>
<p></p>

<li>Lulet - For putting up with me (Love You!)</li>
<li>Loren Segal - for writing an excellent compiler tutorial which some of the compiler was based on (http://gnuu.org/2009/09/18/writing-your-own-toy-compiler/)</li>
<li>Jekyll authors and github - for making my life easier putting this stuff online.</li>

<p>Please note this is purely a hobby for me. I work full time as a games programmer, which often results in long hours, meaning there is less time for fun stuff.</p>
