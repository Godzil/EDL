Emulation Description Language
------------------------------

Requires Bison/Yacc,lex/flex,llvm (2.9) to build the compiler.

Invaders needs the above compiler plus opengl and glfw (3.0). glfw 3.0 is currently only available as source - but i needed the multiple window support available in that version.

Only tested under mingw32 so far. It should build under linux, but the makefile will need tweaking to include the correct libraries.

make

will build the compiler.

make test

will build a test harness, then run a few tests on the 8080 core (including running a test binary image.

make invaders

will build the Space Invaders emulation, you will need the original Midway Space Invaders roms. the should be placed in a folder roms/invaders/ :

roms/invaders/invaders.e
roms/invaders/invaders.f
roms/invaders/invaders.g
roms/invaders/invaders.h
