Emulation Description Language
------------------------------

Requires Bison/Yacc,lex/flex,llvm (2.9) to build the compiler.

Invaders needs the above compiler plus opengl and glfw (3.0). glfw 3.0 is currently only available as source - but i needed the multiple window support available in that version.

Only tested under mingw32 so far. It should build under linux, but the makefile will need tweaking to include the correct libraries.

make

will build the compiler.

tests/ folder includes a simple test harness for validating the 8080 example cores work.

examples/ folder includes a language hello world example, plus 2 space invaders emulators. SimpleInvaders uses the simplified 8080 core. Invaders uses the pin accurate core.
