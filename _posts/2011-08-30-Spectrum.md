 Bit of a slow week, however steady progress has been made. I added support for the <-> (exchange) operator along with ++ & --. ++ & -- are not like C, they are used to imply signed rather than unsigned addition & subtraction. They change the way values are promoted in size, so 16bit++8bit would sign extend 8bit to 16bits then do the addition.

 I've added the remainder of the affactors OVERFLOW,FORCESET,FORCERESET + inverted versions of current ones e.g. NONZERO.

 Finally I've fixed a number of bugs in the compiler and tweaked the way the disassembly is generated, which helps. Anyway I`ll update the documentation later today.

 Oh yeah, also implemented the Z80 in simplified form and added a new example to the examples folder...
