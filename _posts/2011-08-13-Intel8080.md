title: Intel 8080

 The Intel 8080 is an 8 bit microprocessor with a 16 bit address bus, it was produced as a 40 pin DIP. The cpu has 244 official opcodes, the remaining 12 mirror official opcodes. One slightly odd feature is the chip takes 2 seperate clock inputs. One drives the updating of the external pins while the other updates the internal logic.

 The initial goal for the language was to be able to describe the processor accurately from the point of view of the external pins. Essentially I wanted to be able to hook up a logic analyser (or a computer equivalent of one) and see the processor in action. Goal 1 was satisfied :
