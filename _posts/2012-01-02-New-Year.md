 Ok, so i've had a few months off from development - I`m not entirely sure in which direction to take the language at present.

 In the meantime, I have implemented a basic vic 20, c64 and 1541 disk drive, but again, thats all been in C with just the cpu's and support chips done in EDL.

 I`m going to spend some time making a framework for the emulators which might give me an idea of where to proceed with the language (if it needs further work). NB. Some of the language documentation is a bit out of date - I`ll endeavour to sort that out at some point. For now the various examples should be plenty to be going on with.
