 Well it has been nearly a full year since the last post. For most of this year I have been working on other projects (FPGAs and work), however just recently I have been updating EDL adding in multiply/divide/modulus support. The reason for this is I have been working behind the scenes on emulating the Konix Multisystem (you can see the progress on http://www.konixmultisystem.co.uk/).

 There is still a long way to go, and I have plenty of work to do on it, but I thought it time I posted my involvement. Obviously EDL is heavily involved in the emulator, although in its current incarnation it is not trying to be cycle accurate.
