 I haven't made a post in a while (again), however I have made some more progress with EDL. I've added array support along with variable initialisers.

 Over the last month or so, my spare time has been occupied with another emulation - NES. The progress has been good and this is the first time I have implemented the graphics in EDL. Hopefully over the next few weeks I can get the APU moved into the EDL cpu core, if/when i get chance.
 
 The NES unlike the other emulators I have developed, actually generates a composite NTSC signal which can be displayed with the help of a friends TV emulation. The downside of all this accuracy is speed. At present I can get about 14 fps with most features enabled. For the TV signal to start looking good I need to achieve 60. There is plenty of scope for optimisation, EDLs code generator is pretty poor in places, I won't sacrifice PIN accuracy for speed however.

 Anyway below is a older shot I've posted on nesdev before now.. enjoy.
